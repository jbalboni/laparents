<p>The Louisiana Parent Congress is about concerned citizens building partnerships to address critical issues that have an impact on education and encourage local educational programs to work harmoniously with family and friends of education.</p>
 
<p>The Annual meeting presents parent sessions for parents and educators.  The presenters provide useful handouts, manipulative, and resourceful aids in an attempt to provide you with materials needed to reinforce educational skills and enhance student achievement.</p>
   
<p>The EXPO gives every school district in the state the opportunity to exhibit at least one of their exemplary Parental Involvement/Family Literacy Programs.  It is the intent that the EXPO will provide you with additional techniques and information to empower your to meet the needs of your families and establish stronger parental involvement programs in your schools and communities.</p>
